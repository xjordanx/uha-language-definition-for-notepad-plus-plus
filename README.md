# UHA (Unified Hardware Abstraction) Language Syntax File for Notepad++
This file contains the XML definition from the Notepad++ User Defined Language editor.

## Installation
After downloading the UHA.xml file from this repo and saving to a suitable location:
1. Open Notepad++
2. Create a new empty text file and use **File » Save As**, to save the file with extension "*.uha"
3. Open **Language » User Defined » Define Your Language**
4. Click **Import...** and browse to your uha.xml file.

## To Do
This syntax definition was initially built using the example templates from Aggios for the NXP i.MX 8ULP EVK board. It is not complete, as there are constructs around things like interrupt service routines and other modes of operation which were not used on those files for EnergyLab Lite.
If you want to contribute by adding to the definition please do, and initiate a PR.
